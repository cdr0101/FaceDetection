# Face Detection
Different algorithms for face detection    
1. Haar Cascade:
The speed is fine but it has the problem of false positives and can't detect faces for faces in different alignments.
2. MTCNN:
The algorithm is very slow. But the problem of alignment detection is solved.
3. Dlib (Best):
It is fast and can even detect faces in different alignments.
